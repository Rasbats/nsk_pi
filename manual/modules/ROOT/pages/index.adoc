== Plugin NSK_pi

image::nsk_pi_icon.png[NSK logo]

=== Features

The plugin provides a simple converter of NMEA 0183 messages to https://signalk.org[Signal K] delta messages.

The main purpose of this plugin is to serve as a companion to the https://nohal.github.io/dashboardsk_pi/[DashboardSK] plugin in systems where Signal K data is not normally available. A real Signal K server does and always will provide a much richer feature set and is the preferable way to integrate the onboard systems and serve the data to OpenCPN, it's DashboardSK plugin or any other client.

=== Installation

* Open the OpenCPN `Toolbox` by clicking on the cogwheel icon in the main toolbar
* Navigate to the `Plugins` tab
* Update the plugin catalog using the button on the bottom
* Find the `NSK`` tile in the list of available plugins and click on it
* In the presented dialog click the `Install` button

Once the plugin is enabled, it immediately starts converting all the NMEA 0183 sentences it knows to Signal K delta messages and passes them to the OpenCPN core application where they are forwarded to other plugins.

=== Configuration

* To access the plugin's statistics and preferences dialog, navigate to the `Plugins`tab in the `Toolbox`, select the `NSK` and click on the `Preferences` button.

The dialog offers a basic performance statistics and allows disabling conversion for some of the sentences delivered in the NMEA 0183 data feed.

1. Performance statistics
2. Known NMEA 0183 sentences being converted to Signal K deltas. Uncheck the checkbox to stop converting the particular message.
3. NMEA 0183 sentences present in the feed, known to the MarNav library, but not yet implemented by the NSK plugin
4. NMEA 0183 sentences not recognized by the MarNav library
5. If you click the `OK` button, the settings for the sentences are persisted. On `Cancel` the configuration is reverted to it's previous state.

=== Extending the plugin

The primary goal of this plugin is to be as simple as possible both for the user and for anybody willing to extend it's capabilities. A converter for an NMEA 0183 sentence is as simple as

```C++
void NSK::ProcessSentence(std::unique_ptr<marnav::nmea::gll> s,
    rapidjson::Value& values_array,
    rapidjson::Document::AllocatorType& allocator)
{
    Value val(kObjectType);
    Value pos(kObjectType);
    if (s->get_lat().has_value() && s->get_lon().has_value()) {
        pos.AddMember("latitude", s->get_lat()->get(), allocator);
        pos.AddMember("longitude", s->get_lon()->get(), allocator);

        val.AddMember("path", "navigation.position", allocator);
        val.AddMember("value", pos, allocator);
        values_array.PushBack(val, allocator);
    }
}
```

More information about extending the plugin can be found in it's https://github.com/nohal/nsk_pi#readme[source code] repository.

=== Credits

This plugin would not be possible without Mario Konrad's excellent https://github.com/mariokonrad/marnav[MarNav] library doing the dirty work of parsing the NMEA 0183 sentences.
